    "description": "On Smy Mod you can get quoins, but you can't see what amount each is.  Haven't noticed this on other streets.  One thing I've noticed on other streets that maybe just be a lag issue -- sometimes it will do the animation as if you've grabbed a quoin, but it will remain and it won't actually give you the mood/energy/imagination, etc until you walk back over it and it disappears.  Sometimes it will do the animation even if the quoin has already disappeared, though in that case I haven't noticed getting the boost.  Also: crazy quoin amounts vary from street to street, even when my mood is the same.  I think I remember them being the same in Glitch?  But I could either be misremembering or you might have changed it.",

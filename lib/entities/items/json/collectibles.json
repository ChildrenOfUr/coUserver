Systematically, they unpegged each one, and brought them home to pin maps to the walls."

		"description": "Carved of hardest spice tree wood, once adorning the mantlepiece of Gaia, mother of Helen and Harris, this apple was once painted a startlingly shiny gold. This was made by mixing a secret combination of elements, grinding them down with powdered chunks of sparkly and turning them to liquid paint with the careful addition of happy butterfly tears. So desperate were others for the secret recipe that the Apple was stolen almost daily, a little of the patina scraped off each time."

		"description": "Brother and sister, Tanu and Sitha, once each had a pair of gloves. When one glove was lost, Tanu and Sitha used the three remaining gloves between them, holding hands inside the third wherever they went out. When another glove was lost, they only went out in snow one at a time. But down to one glove, they simply sat at home making sure the remaining glove would never be lost. The metal finger on this one may look harmless, but is unbreakable, the weight of an elephant and once on, refuses to leave the finger of whomsoever it has been placed upon."
